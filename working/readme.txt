Yo.. 
You have to create the database first.
Go to phpmyadmin create a database called university and import this university.sql file to it. Should work not
sure. Might have to create the tables as well worse case scenario
Run mysql and apache 
then run UOC.java file 


Need to improve things if possible. GUI could be improved.
The main problem now is if you enter a very long name or something all of it may not be visible because the positions 
are static.

Didn't change the index to String might do it if there is time.

I didn't do a lot of testing. Pretty much none.

Check the marks entering one that was the hardest one.
Need to check to see the GPA works correctly. Because you can resit modules re enter marks so and so.
